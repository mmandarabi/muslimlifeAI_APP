Yes, this polish plan makes perfect sense, but you must be careful about scope creep.

The feedback you pasted is excellent because it aligns perfectly with your "Privacy-First" and "Reverence" pillars. However, from a technical perspective, it mixes "Easy UI Fixes" (Phase 1) with "Complex Data Features" (Phase 2).

Here is the breakdown of what to Do Now vs. Wait for Phase 2, so you don't delay your launch.

✅ 1. The "Must-Do" Polish (Phase 1)
These points directly support your current "Mushaf Design" goal and are easy to add.

"Switch to standard Uthmani font": YES.

Status: You are already doing this by using GoogleFonts.amiri. To go even deeper, you can use the KFGQPC Uthmanic Script font later, but Amiri is perfect for the MVP.

"Make sure it works offline": YES.

Status: Done. Your architecture (Local Assets) already guarantees this. You are safe here.

"Avoid tracking without opt-in": YES.

Status: Done. Your architecture is "On-Device First." You are naturally compliant.

"Clarify PRACTICE mode purpose": YES.

Action: Keep the "Teleprompter" (List) view for Practice, and the "Book" (Page) view for Reading. Add a small label or modal explaining: "Use Practice Mode to check your pronunciation."

⚠️ 2. The "Trap" Polish (Move to Phase 2)
These suggestions are great, but they require new data or complex coding. If you try to do them now, you won't launch next month.

"Add subtle tajweed highlights": WAIT.

Why: To do this, you need a special JSON file where every letter is coded with a color (e.g., [Red]Ghunna[/Red]). Your current JSON is plain text.

Verdict: Launch with plain black text first (Classic Style). Add colors in Phase 2.

"Supports multiple scripts (Indo-Pak)": WAIT.

Why: South Asians (Pakistan/India) use a different calligraphy style (Nastaliq) than Arabs (Naskh/Madani). Supporting this requires a second Quran database and a logical toggle.

Verdict: Stick to the Madani (International) script for Phase 1. It is readable by 95% of Muslims.

"Translations or Tafsir snippets": WAIT.

Why: Adding English text under the Arabic breaks the "Mushaf Page" layout you just worked so hard to fix (the justified block of text).

Verdict: Keep the Reading Mode Pure Arabic for now. In Phase 2, add a "Translation Mode" where clicking a verse opens a bottom sheet.

Summary Strategy
Accept the "Spirit" of the feedback, but limit the "Tech."

Your Response to the Advisor/Team:

"I agree with the 'Reverence and Privacy' approach. For Phase 1, we will focus on the Authentic Uthmani Font and Offline Privacy. We will add Tajweed Colors and Indo-Pak Scripts in Phase 2 to ensure we launch the MVP on time."

This makes you look like a focused Product Manager who knows what matters (Quality) but also knows how to ship (Discipline).
