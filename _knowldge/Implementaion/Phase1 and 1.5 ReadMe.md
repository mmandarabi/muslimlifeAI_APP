Phase 1.5: Stability & UX Improvements — Final Status
Phase 1.5 focused on stabilizing core audio functionality, refining the Quran and Prayer experiences, and preparing the app for production release.
1. Advanced Quran Audio
•	Expanded Reciters: Added Saad Al-Ghamidi and Mishary Rashid Alafasy. Quran recitation selection is now fully independent from the Adhan voice.
•	Tidal-Style Downloads: Implemented a pre-emptive download system for seamless playback.
o	Downloads can be cancelled instantly via the Stop button.
o	Switching surahs immediately aborts the previous download to conserve bandwidth.
o	A real-time “Downloading…” indicator provides clear user feedback.
•	Universal Controls: Playback state and download indicators are synchronized across the main Quran screen and Read Mode App Bar.
2. Prayer Screen Optimization
•	No-Scroll Layout: Refined spacing, typography, and vertical rhythm so the countdown, prayer list, and reminders fit comfortably on a single screen.
•	Adhan Stop Fix: Resolved a state synchronization issue that caused the Adhan to restart after manual stopping.
•	Clarity Improvements: Updated the permission dialog with explicit, high-contrast button text for better accessibility.
3. Release Readiness
•	Version: v1.0.3+5
•	Build: Production app-release.aab generated and ready for store deployment.
Note
The Phase 2: Immersive Player initiative (Global Mini-Player and Now Playing screen) has been fully specified and documented in implementation_plan.md. Execution will begin in Phase 2 to avoid introducing risk into the current release.
